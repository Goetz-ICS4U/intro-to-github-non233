**Instructions**

Part 1: Clone the Repository

	Click the GitHub Classroom assignment link provided in Google Classroom
	Accept the assignment (this creates your personal copy of the repository)
	Wait for GitHub to finish setting up your repository
	Once ready, click the link to your new repository
	Click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL
	Open VSCode
	Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) to open the Command Palette
	Type "Git: Clone" and select it
	Paste the repository URL and press Enter
	Choose a folder location to store the project (Do this in Unit 0 folder)
	When prompted, click "Open" to open the cloned repository in VSCode

**Part 2: Complete the Profile**

	Open the file student_profile.md in your favorite text editor
	Fill in your information where indicated
	Save the file

**Part 3: Write Your First Program**

	Open the file hello.py (or create it if it doesn't exist)
	Write a simple program that prints "Hello, GitHub!" and your name
	Test your program by running: python hello.py

**Part 4: Commit Your Changes**

	Click the Source Control icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+G)
	Review your modified files in the "Changes" section
	Hover over "Changes" and click the + icon to stage all files, or click the + next to individual files
	Type a commit message in the text box at the top: "Complete student profile and hello program"
	Click the checkmark icon above the message box (or press Ctrl+Enter) to commit

**Part 5: Push to GitHub**

	In the Source Control panel, click the ... (three dots) menu
	Select "Push" (or press Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Git: Push")
	Note: Your branch might be called master instead of main and that's okay!
	Go to your repository on GitHub and verify your changes appear

**Submission**
Your work is automatically submitted when you push to GitHub! I can see all your commits and files in your assignment repository. The repository name will include your GitHub username (e.g., github-basic-yourusername).

**Common Issues and Solutions**

"Permission denied" error when pushing:

	Make sure you've accepted the GitHub Classroom assignment
	Check that you're pushing to your own assignment repository (it should have your GitHub username in the repository name)
	You may need to authenticate with GitHub (VSCode will prompt you to sign in)

Can't find the assignment link:

	Check your email or your course's learning management system
	Ask your instructor to reshare the link

"Remote origin already exists":

	This is normal after cloning, just proceed with your work

Changes not showing on GitHub:

	Make sure you committed your changes (check the Source Control panel)
	Make sure you pushed them (look for "Push" option in Source Control menu)
	Refresh your GitHub repository page in your browser

**Submission**

	Your work is automatically submitted when you push to GitHub. I can see all your commits and files.
